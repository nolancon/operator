                                      sends the user UID from the client. If the client
                                      is running as root, this sends uid=0. Root squashing
                                      allows the NFS administrator to prevent the
                                      client from writing as "root" to the NFS share,
                                      instead mapping the client to a new UID/GID
                                      (usually nfsnobody, -2). "none" performs no
                                      UID/GID alterations, using the values sent by
                                      the client. "root" mapps UID & GID 0 to the
                                      values specified. "rootuid" maps UID 0 and
                                      a GID of any value to the value specified. "all"
                                      maps changes all UID and GID values to those
                                      specified.
